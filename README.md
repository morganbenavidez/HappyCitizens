<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

There seems to be a need for citizens to keep track of their property in case of natural disaster and crisis. The need is that oftentimes citizens run into issues of property theft and damage and need a way to track that so that they can properly create the detailed reports necessary so that they file a claim to the insurance. Therefore, The City of Happy Citizens is seeking to provide such a service and our team is willing and capable to provide it.Â
